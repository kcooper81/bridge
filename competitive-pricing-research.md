## PRICING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TEAMPROMPT

Based on this competitive analysis, here are data-driven pricing recommendations:

### Recommended Tier Structure

| Tier | Suggested Price | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Essential for adoption. Limit to ~50 prompts, 1 workspace, personal use only. Competitors with generous free tiers (AIPRM, Magical) have larger user bases. |
| **Pro** (Individual) | $8–$10/mo | Aligns with PromptBox ($9.99), AIPRM Plus ($9), Magical Core ($6.50), TextExpander Individual ($3.33). Sweet spot for solo power users. |
| **Team** | $6–$8/user/mo | Matches password manager team tiers ($4–$8/user) and Chrome extension team pricing ($8–$12/user). Per-seat model. |
| **Business** | $10–$14/user/mo | Aligns with TextExpander Growth ($10.83), Workona Team ($10), Loom ($15). Include SSO, admin controls, analytics. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Standard for 50+ seat deployments. Include SAML SSO, SCIM, audit logs, dedicated support. |

### Key Pricing Patterns Observed

1. **Per-seat is standard** for team tools: $4–$12/user/month is the dominant range.
2. **Starter packs** (flat rate for ~10 users at ~$20/mo) lower friction for small teams.
3. **Free tiers are critical** — every successful Chrome extension offers one.
4. **Annual billing discounts** of 15–30% are universal.
5. **No AI prompt manager has strong team pricing** — this is TeamPrompt's primary market opportunity.
6. **Chrome extensions** typically price lower than full SaaS platforms ($5–$12 vs. $15–$20+).

### Competitive Positioning

TeamPrompt sits at the **intersection of two categories** where no strong competitor exists:
- AI Prompt Managers (Category 1) lack team/per-seat pricing
- Team Chrome Extensions (Category 3) don't manage AI prompts

The closest competitor is **AIPRM Elite at $99/mo** for team features, but it bundles team admin into an expensive individual plan rather than offering affordable per-seat pricing. A TeamPrompt team plan at **$7–$8/user/month** would undercut AIPRM's team offering dramatically while aligning with established per-seat norms from password managers and team Chrome extensions.
